<div class="talk-abstract" style="display: block; width: 80%; height: 100%;">
  <p>We first introduce our approximate homomorphic encryption HEAAN. HEAAN supports fixed-point operations via addition, multiplication and rescaling of plaintext vectors. This feature significantly accelerates approximate arithmetic of real numbers (compared with bit-wise arithmetics) and realizes machine learning on encrypted data. We introduce several implementation results about logistic regression, Deep Neural Network, and Recurrent Neural Network on encrypted data. Another important operation includes logical operations such as min/max and comparison. We suggest a novel approach to efficient homomorphic comparison algorithm. As an application, we introduce our implementation results on encrypted sorting.

  <div class="talk-abstract" style="display: block; width: 80%; height: 100%;">
  <p>Abstract: Non-malleable secret sharing was recently proposed by Goyal and Kumar in independent tampering and joint tampering models for threshold secret sharing (STOC18) and secret sharing with general access structure (CRYPTO18). The idea of making secret sharing non-malleable received great attention and by now has generated many papers exploring new frontiers in this topic, such as multiple-time tampering and adding leakage resiliency to the one-shot tampering model. Non-compartmentalized tampering model was first studied by Agrawal et.al (CRYPTO15) for non-malleability against permutation composed with bit-wise independent tampering, and shown useful in constructing non-malleable string commitments. </p>

<p>We initiate the study of leakage-resilient secret sharing in the non-compartmentalized model.
Leakage in leakage-resilient secret sharing is usually modelled as arbitrary functions with bounded total output length applied to each share or up to a certain number of shares (but never the full share vector) at one time. We allow the leakage functions to be applied to the full share vector (non-compartmentalized) but restrict to the class of affine leakage functions. The leakage adversary can corrupt several players and obtain their shares, as in normal secret sharing. The leakage adversary can apply arbitrary affine functions with bounded total output length to the full share vector and obtain the outputs as leakage. These two processes can be both non-adaptive and do not depend on each other, or both adaptive and depend on each other with arbitrary ordering. We use a generic approach that combines randomness extractors with error correcting codes to construct such leakage-resilient secret sharing schemes, and achieve constant information ratio (the scheme for non-adaptive adversary is near optimal).</p>

<p>We then explore making the non-compartmentalized leakage-resilient secret sharing also non-malleable against tampering. We consider a tampering model, where the adversary can use the shares obtained from the corrupted players and the outputs of the global leakage functions to choose a tampering function from a tampering family F. We give two constructions of such leakage-resilient non-malleable secret sharing for the case F is the bit-wise independent tampering and, respectively, for the case F is the affine tampering functions, the latter is non-compartmentalized tampering that subsumes the permutation composed with bit-wise independent tampering mentioned above.

n lattice  assumptions. One caveat is that they are only known to be secure in the static corruption setting, where the adversary chooses the servers to corrupt at the very beginning of the game, before any evaluation query. In this work, we construct the first fully non-interactive adaptively secure DPRF in the standard model. Our construction is proved secure under the LWE assumption against adversaries that may adaptively decide which servers they want to corrupt. We also extend our construction in order to achieve robustness against malicious adversaries.

<div class="talk-abstract" style="display: block; width: 80%; height: 100%;">
  <p>We devise new techniques for design and analysis of efficient lattice-based zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP). First, we introduce one-shot proof techniques for non-linear polynomial relations of degree k ≥ 2, where the protocol achieves a negligible soundness error in a single execution, and thus performs significantly better in both computation and communication compared to prior protocols requiring multiple repetitions. Such proofs with degree k ≥ 2 have been crucial ingredients for important privacy-preserving protocols in the discrete logarithm setting. Moreover, we introduce two speedup techniques for lattice-based ZKPs: a CRT-packing technique supporting “inter-slot” operations, and “NTTfriendly” tools that permit the use of fully-splitting rings. The former technique comes at almost no cost to the proof length, and the latter one barely increases it, which can be compensated for by tweaking the rejection sampling parameters while still having faster computation overall. To illustrate the utility of our techniques, we show how to use them to build efficient relaxed proofs for important relations, namely proof of commitment to bits, one-out-of-many proof, range proof and set membership proof. Despite their relaxed nature, we further show how our proof systems can be used as building blocks for advanced cryptographic tools such as ring signatures. Our ring signature achieves a dramatic improvement in length over all the existing proposals from lattices at the same security level. The computational evaluation also shows that our construction is highly likely to outperform all the relevant works in running times.

 <div class="talk-abstract" style="display: block; width: 80%; height: 100%;">
  <p>Signcryption aims to provide both confidentiality and authentication of messages more efficiently than the independent application of encryption and signature. In the talk, we consider a generic and efficient signcryption scheme featuring parallel encryption and signature on top of a sponge-based message-padding underlying structure. Unlike other existing schemes, the proposed scheme also supports arbitrary long messages. We prove the construction secure when instantiated from weakly secure asymmetric primitives such as a trapdoor one-way encryption and a universal unforgeable signature.

<div class="talk-abstract" style="display: block; width: 80%; height: 100%;">
  <p>Together with forward security, backward security is one of key security requirements for dynamic searchable symmetric encryption. Recently, Kim et al. proposed a new database structure, called dual dictionary, which can be seen as a combination of forward and inverted indexes. On top of this, they presented a new dynamic searchable symmetric encryption scheme. (ACM CCS 2017) It supports forward security, but unfortunately does not support backward security. In this talk, we provide a new dynamic searchable symmetric encryption scheme under dual dictionary structures. Our proposed construction achieves backward security as well as keeps the advantages of Kim et al.’s constructions.

<div class="talk-abstract" style="display: block; width: 80%; height: 100%;">
  <p>In the last few years, we have seen great progress in lattice-based non-interactive zero-knowledge proof systems (NIZKs) in the standard model. Kim and Wu [CRYPTO'18] constructed a variant of NIZKs called designated-prover NIZKs (DP-NIZKs), Lombardi et al. [CRYPTO'19] constructed a variant of NIZKs called designated-verifier NIZKs (DV-NIZKs), and finally, Peikert and Shiehian [CRYPTO'19] constructed full-fledged NIZKs. Interestingly, all works follow a different design methodology, and accordingly, some require weaker assumptions than others. Notably, DP-NIZKs can be based solely on the short integer solution (SIS) assumption, however, it seems we additionally need to assume the learning with errors (LWE) assumption for DV-NIZKs and standard NIZKs.  Since we do not know how to construct public-key encryption schemes based on SIS, while we do know how to base it on LWE, there seems to clearly be a gap.
</p> 
<p>In this talk, we will look into this disparity through the lens of various signature schemes. For example, we know standard signature schemes can be based solely on SIS. This is demonstrated by the fact the DP-NIZK is sufficient to construct signature schemes. On the other hand, thus far, ring signature schemes seem to require LWE (whose construction can only be attained by using standard NIZKs). We also look at how to generalize the notion of DP-NIZKs and see that it is actually implied by attribute-based signature schemes which can be built from SIS. Moreover, using this new notion of generalized DP-NIZKs we build the first group-signature schemes based on SIS which satisfy a slightly weaker notion of anonymity than the standard one. This weakening of the anonymity notion may perhaps be inherent since otherwise, such strong group signature schemes imply public-key encryption schemes. </p>

<div class="talk-abstract" style="display: block; width: 80%; height: 100%;">
  <p>Non-malleable codes (NMCs), introduced by Dziembowski, Pietrzak and Wichs [DPW10], provide a useful message integrity guarantee in situations where traditional error-correction (and even error-detection) is impossible; for example, when the attacker can completely overwrite the encoded message. NMCs have emerged as a fundamental object at the intersection of coding theory and cryptography. In particular, progress in the study of non-malleable codes and the related notion of non-malleable extractors has led to new insights and progress on even more fundamental problems like the construction of multi-source randomness extractors.</p> 
<p>A large body of the recent work has focused on various constructions of non-malleable codes in the split-state model. Many variants of NMCs have been introduced in the literature i.e. strong NMCs, super strong NMCs and continuous NMCs. The most general, and hence also the most useful notion among these is that of continuous non-malleable codes, that allows for continuous tampering by the adversary.</p>
 <p>We present the first efficient information-theoretically secure continuously non-malleable code in the constant split-state model, where there is a self-destruct mechanism which ensures that the adversary loses access to tampering after the first failed decoding.</p>
